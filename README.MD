# Archetypes!

This is a library developed to run what might be called a "souped-up dictionary method" for psychological text analysis. Or any kind of text analysis, really.

The core idea behind *Archetypes* is that you pre-define a set of prototypical sentences that reflect the construct that you are looking to measure in a body of text. Using modern contextual embeddings, then, this library will aggregate your prototypes into an *archetypal* representation of your construct. Then, you can quantify texts in your corpus for their semantic similarity to your construct(s) of interest.

*Note*: For the curious: no, this approach not inspired by anything [Jungian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes) in nature. In the past, I've [said a few things](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2019.1633122?casa_token=cnHLr5uwiXUAAAAA:ACUCFK4tC9HXBBMlfhIFjfPxWLuCEK7owT3z_IBv2rZUa35fq4Z_rVkETqGO0wa1FqYjbmgxcRWxnw) about Jungian archetypes that have inspired scholars to write more than a few frustrated e-mails to me. Apologies to the Jungians.

# Requirements
If you want to run the library "out of the box" you will need to first install the following packages:
- `numpy`
- `tqdm`
- `torch`
- `sentence_transformers`
- `nltk`

You can try to install these all in one go by running the following command from your terminal/cmd:
`pip install numpy tqdm torch sentence_transformers nltk`

Future updates to this repo may (or may not!) include an actual requirements.txt file and other .whl building tidbits, but for now, the above minimal setup should make life pretty easy.

# Examples

I have provided an example notebook in this repo that walks through the basic process of using this library, along with demonstrations of a few important "helper" functions to help you evaluate the statistical/psychometric qualities of your archetypes.
